# DRN (Depletion-Enhancement NMOS) Transistor Fabrication Project

## Overview

This project illustrates the fabrication process of Depletion-Enhancement NMOS (DRN) transistors, a technology that predates CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor). In the 70s, before the widespread adoption of CMOS technology, NMOS (N-type Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) transistors were fabricated with both enhancement and depletion types operating in parallel.

## Project Description

The objective of this project is to draw a transistor fabrication process analogous to that of CMOS, showcasing the steps involved in creating both enhancement and depletion type NMOS transistors. The fabrication process is visually depicted in a GIF file, providing a step-by-step guide to the process.
